        Manmohan Singh (Punjabi: [mənˈmoːɦən ˈsɪ́ŋɡ] ⓘ; 26 September 1932 – 26
        December 2024) was an Indian politician, economist, academic, and
        bureaucrat, who served as the 13th prime minister of India from 2004 to
        2014. He was the fourth longest-serving prime minister after Jawaharlal
        Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Narendra Modi.[1] A member of the Indian
        National Congress, Singh was the first Sikh prime minister of India.[2]
        He was also the first prime minister since Jawaharlal Nehru to be
        re-elected after completing a full five-year term.
        <br />

        Born in Gah in what is today Pakistan, Singh's family migrated to India
        during its partition in 1947. After obtaining his doctorate in economics
        from Oxford, Singh worked for the United Nations during 1966–1969. He
        subsequently began his bureaucratic career when Lalit Narayan Mishra
        hired him as an advisor in the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. During
        the 1970s and 1980s, Singh held several key posts in the Government of
        India, such as Chief Economic Advisor (1972–1976), governor of the
        Reserve Bank (1982–1985) and head of the Planning Commission
        (1985–1987).
